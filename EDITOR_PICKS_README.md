## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/admin/editor-picks` - Update editor picks

### Components

- `PostsManagement` - Enhanced admin interface with editor picks management

### Data Storage

Editor picks are stored in the local `site-settings.json` file as an array of post IDs:

```json
{
  "siteTitle": "Tech Oblivion",
  "siteUrl": "http://localhost:3000",
  "editorPicks": [123, 456, 789]
}
```

## Testing

1. **Test Admin Interface**
   - Log in as an editor/admin
   - Navigate to `/admin/posts`
   - Toggle editor picks mode and select/deselect posts

2. **Test Home Page Display**
   - Set some editor picks in admin
   - Visit the home page and verify they appear in "Editor's Picks" section
   - Clear all editor picks and verify fallback posts are shown

3. **Test Permissions**
   - Try accessing `/api/admin/editor-picks` without proper permissions
   - Should receive 401/403 errors

## Troubleshooting

- **Posts not appearing**: Check that selected posts are published (not drafts)
- **Permission errors**: Verify user has editor+ role permissions
