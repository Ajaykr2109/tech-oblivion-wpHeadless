# Session Changes & Project Overview

This document summarizes the significant improvements made to the application during our session and provides a complete list of all the pages and routes.

## Summary of Changes Made

Throughout this session, we focused on transforming the initial boilerplate into a polished, professional, and feature-rich content management system. Key upgrades include:

1.  **Homepage Enhancements**:
    *   Added "Featured Posts" and "Most Popular" sections to showcase key content.
    *   Integrated a "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)" section using an accordion for a clean user experience.
    *   Added a prominent "Become an Open Author" call-to-action banner to encourage user contribution.

2.  **Complete Editor Overhaul**:
    *   Redesigned the post editor from a basic textarea into a professional **two-column layout** with a dedicated settings sidebar.
    *   Implemented a rich **Markdown Toolbar** with icons and tooltips for intuitive formatting (Bold, Italic, Headings, Lists, etc.).
    *   Added advanced **SEO Tools**, including a live Google search result preview and fields for meta title, description, and focus keywords.
    *   Integrated a foundational **Auto Internal Linking** tool to suggest related posts based on keywords.
    *   Added a pre-publish **SEO Checklist** to guide authors in creating optimized content.
    *   Included a live **Word Count and Reading Time** indicator.
    *   Made the main action buttons (**Publish, Save Draft**) sticky in the sidebar for constant access.

3.  **UI/UX and Readability Improvements**:
    *   **Redesigned Authentication Pages**: Replaced basic HTML on Login, Register, and Forgot Password pages with modern `shadcn/ui` components for a consistent look and feel.
    *   **Improved Header Navigation**: Reorganized the main navigation menu with clearer sub-menus for "Admin" and "User Dashboard."
    *   **Enhanced Color Palette**: Updated the global stylesheet with a more professional and readable color scheme for both light and dark modes.
    *   **Refined Blog Filters**: Redesigned the filter/search bar on the main blog page into a sleek, compact, horizontal layout.
