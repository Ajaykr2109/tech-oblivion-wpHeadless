This project implements a Next.js App Router frontend that proxies WordPress auth via API routes.

Key features:
- Proxy auth: POST /api/auth/login, /api/auth/register, /api/auth/logout, GET /api/auth/me
- HttpOnly session cookie is set on login (7 days)
- CSRF double-submit: cookie 'csrf' must match x-csrf-token header for mutating routes
- Middleware protects /dashboard and /account
- Blog list and post pages fetch from WP REST and render server-side

Testing
1. Set environment in `.env.local`.
2. Start dev server: npm run dev
3. Visit `/register` to create account. With AIOS email activation, expect 201 { status: 'pending_verification' } and UI shows pending message.
4. Try to login before verification â†’ expect 401 and friendly message.
5. After verifying via WP email link, login should succeed and set HttpOnly cookie. Visiting `/dashboard` should show the user.
