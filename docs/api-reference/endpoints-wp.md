description: Grouped by namespace with per-route summaries. Generated snapshot for reference.

This is a readable snapshot of the WordPress REST API available on the connected site, grouped by namespace. It’s derived from a crawl of `/wp-json` and trimmed to the essentials for humans. For full detail, re-run the crawler and regenerate.

See also:

- proxy-map.md — Next.js API → WP endpoints (generated)
- proxy-map-with-roles.md — Same with RBAC columns (generated)
- roles-matrix.md — Per-route/method RBAC (generated)


To refresh this snapshot, use scripts/api-tools.sh (dbcheck/smoke) or your own crawler.

Note: The original long-form listing lived in docs/api-end-wp.md. It has been superseded by this concise snapshot; retain the original history in git if needed.
