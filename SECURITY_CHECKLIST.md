- [x] **Environment Validation** - Schema validation for required environment variables
- [ ] **Vault Integration** - Consider HashiCorp Vault for secret management
- [x] **Development Security** - Different configs for dev/staging/production

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Deployment & Monitoring

- [ ] **Security Monitoring** - Implement Sentry, Datadog, or similar for security events
- [x] **Audit Logging** - Security events logged (authentication, authorization failures)
- [ ] **Alerting System** - Alerts for suspicious activity (brute force, unusual access patterns)
- [ ] **Regular Security Reviews** - Schedule quarterly security audits
- [ ] **Penetration Testing** - Annual third-party security assessment
- [x] **Dependency Scanning** - Automated security scanning with npm audit

## üìä Security Metrics & KPIs

- **Authentication Success Rate**: Monitor for brute force attempts
- **Rate Limit Hits**: Track API abuse attempts  
- **CSP Violations**: Monitor for XSS attempts
- **Failed Authorization**: Track privilege escalation attempts
- **Password Breach Detections**: Monitor weak password usage

## üîß Security Tooling & Integration
