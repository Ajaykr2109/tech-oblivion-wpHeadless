# Editor Pre-selection Test

## What was implemented:

1. **Enhanced logging**: Added comprehensive console logging to track the loading and pre-selection process
2. **Improved loading sequence**: Categories and tags are now loaded before the post data to ensure they're available for pre-selection
3. **Better error handling**: Added more detailed error messages and status tracking
4. **Debug information**: Added development-mode debug displays to show selected category and tag IDs
5. **Enhanced metadata extraction**: Now properly extracts and logs additional post metadata like featured media, post format, visibility, etc.

## How to test:

1. Navigate to an existing post in the editor (e.g., `/editor/4798`)
2. Open browser dev tools to see console logs
3. Verify that:
   - Categories load first
   - Tags load second  
   - Post data loads third with embedded taxonomy data
   - Selected category ID is logged and displayed
   - Selected tag IDs are logged and displayed
   - Category dropdown shows the correct pre-selected value
   - Tag badges show the correct pre-selected tags

## Expected console output sequence:

```
Loaded categories: X
Loaded tags: Y
Fetching post with ID: 4798
Response status: 200 OK
API Response: {...}
All embedded terms: [categories_array, tags_array]
Extracted categories: [...]
Extracted tags: [...]
Pre-selected category ID: X
Pre-selected tag IDs: [X, Y, Z]
Post data loaded and state updated with pre-selected options
```

## What should be pre-selected:

- **Category**: The category the post was originally published to
- **Tags**: All tags that were originally assigned to the post
- **Status**: Draft, Published, or Pending Review based on post.status
- **SEO Title**: From Yoast or post title
- **SEO Description**: From Yoast or post excerpt
- **Focus Keyword**: From Yoast metadata
- **Slug**: Post slug for URL

## Debug features (development only):

- Debug display showing selected category ID
- Debug display showing selected tag IDs array
- Comprehensive console logging of the entire loading process
